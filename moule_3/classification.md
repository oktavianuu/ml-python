## <center>Classification<center>
- Classification is a supervised learning approach, which can be thought of classifying some unknown items into a discrete set of "classes".
- Classification attempts to learn the relationship between a set of feature variables and a target variablle of interest. 
- The target variable in classification is a categorical with discrete values. 

### How classification and classifiers work?
**Scenario**:
- suppose a bank is concerned about the potential for loans not to be repaid. 
- the bank can use the previous loans data to predict which customers are likely to have problem of repaying loans. 
- the data can be used to classify a "bad risk" customer. 
- the goal of the prediction is to use the previous data such as age, income, education, etc. to build a classifier to classify new incoming customer then label them as 0 (bad risk) and 1 (okay).
