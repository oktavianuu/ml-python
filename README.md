# ml-python
The study of machine learning with python.
This study consisted of five modules:
1. Module 1: Machine Learning
This module discusses various real world applications of machine learning, such as those in the healthcare, telecommunications and financial industries. Moreover, this module will discuss the Python libraries that can be used to implement machine learning models and be introduced to the supervised and unsupervised algorithms.
2. Module 2: Regression
This module discusses simple linear regression, multiple linear and non-linear regression and their applications. This module also discuss model evaluation metrics for regression such as mean absolute error and mean squared error, as well as learning about two types of evaluation approaches: training and testing on the same dataset and train/test split, moreover, apply these methods.
3. Module 3: Classification 
This module discuses classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. This module also evaluation metrics for classifiers such as the Jaccard index, F1-score and Log Loss.
4. Module 4: Clustering
This module discusses clustering approaches such as K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Clustering can be used for customer segmentation or grouping weather stations.Jaccard index, F1-score and Log Loss.
5. Module 5: Recommender System
content-based and collaborative filtering.
