**Major Machine Learning Techniques**
- Regression/Estimation
  - Predicting continuous values
- Classification
  - Predicting the item class/category
- Clustering
  - Finding the structure of data/association
- Associations
  - Associating frequent co-occuring items/events
- Anomaly detection
  - discovering abnormal and unusual cases. For example, credit card or fraud detection.
- Sequence mining
  - Predicting next event, for example click-stream in websites.
- Dimension reduction
  - Reducing the data size (PCA)
- Recomendation systems
  - Recomending items

**Differences between AI, ML and DL**
- AI tries to make computer intelligent in order to mimic the cognitice function of humans.
- Machine learning is a branch of AI that deals with statistical parts of AI. It teaches the computer to solve problems by looking at hundreds of thousands of examples, learning from them and solve the same problem in new situations.
- Deep Learning, a very special fields of machine learning where computers is actually learn and make intelligent decisions on their own. 

**Python Libraries for Machine Learning**
- **NumPy** 
  - a math library to work with n-dimensional array. 
  - used to do computation efficiently and effectively. 
- **SciPy**
  - a collection of numerical algorithms and domain specific tool-box, for example, signal processing, statistics and optimization (and much more)
- **MatPlotlib**
  - ploting package for 2D and 3D visualization.
- **Pandas**
  - high performance and easy to use data strucure.
  - used to import, manipulate and analyze data.
  - provides data structure and oprations for manipulating numerical tables and time-series.

**More about Scikit-learn**
- It is popular, free and designed for python and provide many algorithms for machine learning. 

**Supervised vs Unsupervised**
- Supervised: 
  - this is a ML algorithm that solve a problem based on trained data. This type of algorithm only know how to solve problem based on labeled data. 
  - two types of supervised learning technique:
    - regression: predicting continuous value
    - classification: predicting class label or category
  - 
- Unsupervised: this one is a type of ML algorithm that learn by itself. It can solve totally new kind of problem from unseen data. We do not supervise the model, it works on its own to solve a problem. It draws conclusion on UNLABELED data. 
  - example: 
    - dimension reduction: reducing redundant feature to make classification easier.
    - density estimation: explore data to find structure within it.
    - clustering: grouping data points or objects that are somehow similar.
**NOTE**: Supervised learning deals with labeled data, unsupervised learning is the opposite. In comparison, unsupervised learning has fewer models and fewer evaluation methods that can be used to ensure that the outcome of the model is accurate.  Unsupervised learning creates less controllable environment as the algorithm creates the outcome for us.
